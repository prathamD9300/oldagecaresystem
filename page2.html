  <p>Eating a well-balanced diet is an important part of staying healthy as you age. It can help you maintain a healthy weight, stay energized, and get the nutrients you need. It also lowers your risk of developing chronic health conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes.
</p>
<h2>How Do Your Needs and Habits Change with Age?
</h2>
<p>As you get older, your nutritional needs, appetite, and food habits can change in several ways.
    
    </p>
<h3><u>Calories
    </u></h3>
    <p>You'll probably need fewer calories as you age to maintain a healthy weight. Eating more calories than you burn leads to weight gain.
        You may find you have less energy and more muscle or joint problems as you get older. As a result, you may become less mobile and burn fewer calories through physical activity. You may also lose muscle mass. This causes your metabolism to slow down, lowering your caloric needs.</p>
  
        <h3><u>Appetite

        </u></h3>
        <p>Many people experience a loss of appetite with age. It's also common for your sense of taste and smell to diminish. This can lead you to eat less.
            If you're burning fewer calories through physical activity, eating less may not be a problem. However, you need to get enough calories and nutrients to maintain healthy organs, muscles, and bones. Not getting enough can lead to malnutrition and health problems.
            </p>
            <h3><u>Medical Conditions
            </u></h3>
            <p>YAs you age, you become more susceptible to chronic health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and osteoporosis. To help prevent or treat these conditions, your doctor may recommend changes to your diet.
                For example, if you've been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol, you should eat foods that are rich in nutrients, but low in excess calories, processed sugars, and saturated and trans fats. Your doctor may also advise you to eat less sodium.
                Some older adults become sensitive to foods such as onions, peppers, dairy products, and spicy foods.
                You may need to cut some of these foods out of your diet.
                </p>
                <h3><u>Medications

                </u></h3>
                <p>You may need to take medications to manage chronic health conditions. Some medications can affect your appetite. Some can also interact with certain foods and nutritional supplements.
                    For example, if you're taking warfarin (Coumadin), you need to avoid grapefruit. It decreases your body's ability to metabolize the drug. You also need to maintain a steady level of vitamin K in your diet. You can get vitamin K from eating plenty of spinach, kale, or other leafy greens.
                    </p>
                    <h3><u>Oral Health


                    </u></h3>
                    <p>Seniors have their own set of oral health concerns.
                        Some of these can interfere with your ability to eat. For example, dentures that don't fit properly may lead to poor eating habits and malnutrition. Infections in your mouth can also cause problems.
                        
                        </p>
                        <h3><u>Immune System


                        </u></h3>
                        <p>Your immune system weakens with age. This raises your risk of food-borne illness, or food poisoning.
                            Proper food safety techniques are important at every age. However, you may need to take extra precautions as your immune system weakens. For example, your doctor may recommend avoiding foods with raw eggs, such as homemade mayonnaise or Caesar salad dressing.
                            </p>                                          
                              <!-- <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Get active:</strong> Physical activity is an immune system booster. The more you move, the more your body is able to fight inflammation and infections.
      The activity you partake in doesn't have to be strenuous. Low impact exercises are effective, too.
      You might consider biking, walking, swimming, or low impact aerobics. If you're able to, engage in moderate intensity exercise for about 20 to 30 minutes a day to reach the recommended total of 150 minutes a weekTrusted Source. Also, strengthen your muscles by lifting weights or doing yoga.
      Modify your exercise routine to find what feels best for you.
      
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Take supplements as necessary
        :</strong> Some supplements help support a healthy immune system. Before taking a supplement, always ask your doctor if it's safe, especially if you're taking a prescription medication. Some supplements they may recommend include calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B6, or vitamin B12.

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Eat a healthy diet
        :</strong> DDiets rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean meats also give your immune system a boost and protect against harmful viruses and bacteria that cause illnesses.
        Fruits and vegetables are a good source of antioxidants. Antioxidants protect your cells from damage and keep your body healthy.
        You should also limit your consumption of sugary and fatty foods, which can trigger inflammation in the body and lower your immune system.
        
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Wash your hands frequently
        :</strong> Washing your hands on a regular basis is another excellent way to stay healthy year-round. Viruses can live on surfaces for up to 24 hours. It's possible to become ill if you touch a virus-covered surface and contaminate your hands, and then touch your face.
        Wash your hands with warm soapy water often, and for at least 20 seconds. Avoid touching your nose, face, and mouth with your hands.
        
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Get plenty of rest:</strong> Not only can sleep reduce your stress level, but sleep is how your body repairs itself. For this reason, getting an adequate amount of sleep can result in a stronger immune system, making it easier for your body to fight off viruses.
      Sleep is also important as you get older because it can improve memory and concentration. Aim for at least seven and a half to nine hours of sleep per night.
      If you have trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor to find the underlying cause. Causes of insomnia can include inactivity during the day and too much caffeine. Or it can be a sign of a medical condition like sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome.
