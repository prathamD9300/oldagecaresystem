      <strong>Get active:</strong> Physical activity is an immune system booster. The more you move, the more your body is able to fight inflammation and infections.
      The activity you partake in doesn't have to be strenuous. Low impact exercises are effective, too.
      You might consider biking, walking, swimming, or low impact aerobics. If you're able to, engage in moderate intensity exercise for about 20 to 30 minutes a day to reach the recommended total of 150 minutes a weekTrusted Source. Also, strengthen your muscles by lifting weights or doing yoga.
      Modify your exercise routine to find what feels best for you.

      <strong>Take supplements as necessary
        :</strong> Some supplements help support a healthy immune system. Before taking a supplement, always ask your doctor if it's safe, especially if you're taking a prescription medication. Some supplements they may recommend include calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B6, or vitamin B12.

      <strong>Eat a healthy diet
        :</strong> DDiets rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean meats also give your immune system a boost and protect against harmful viruses and bacteria that cause illnesses.
        Fruits and vegetables are a good source of antioxidants. Antioxidants protect your cells from damage and keep your body healthy.
        You should also limit your consumption of sugary and fatty foods, which can trigger inflammation in the body and lower your immune system.

      <strong>Wash your hands frequently
        :</strong> Washing your hands on a regular basis is another excellent way to stay healthy year-round. Viruses can live on surfaces for up to 24 hours. It's possible to become ill if you touch a virus-covered surface and contaminate your hands, and then touch your face.
        Wash your hands with warm soapy water often, and for at least 20 seconds. Avoid touching your nose, face, and mouth with your hands.
        
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Get plenty of rest:</strong> Not only can sleep reduce your stress level, but sleep is how your body repairs itself. For this reason, getting an adequate amount of sleep can result in a stronger immune system, making it easier for your body to fight off viruses.
      Sleep is also important as you get older because it can improve memory and concentration. Aim for at least seven and a half to nine hours of sleep per night.
      If you have trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor to find the underlying cause. Causes of insomnia can include inactivity during the day and too much caffeine. Or it can be a sign of a medical condition like sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome.
