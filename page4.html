  <!-- <h3>The Health Benefits of Exercise in Older Adults
</h3>
<p>Our biology changes as we get older, causing seniors to have different reasons for staying in shape than younger generations. Though physical fitness provides benefits at any age, the health perks physically fit seniors enjoy are more notable.
    Physicians and researchers say seniors should remain as active as possible, without overexerting one's self.
    In older adults, exercise helps you live a longer, healthier, and more joyous life.

      <strong>Cold
        </strong> <p>The common cold is an upper respiratory tract infection caused by many different viruses. The common cold is transmitted by virus-infected airborne droplets or by direct contact with infected secretions.

        Typical common cold symptoms include :

<br>
<ol><li>cough,

</li><li> sore throat,

</li><li>coughing,

</li><li>sneezing, and

</li><li>a runny nose.

</li></ol>
      <p>Being in cold weather does not cause the common cold, but cold weather promotes close contact. Over-the-counter medications may be used for the treatment of the common cold.
        Antibiotics are not necessary for the common cold.

      <strong>Resistance band workouts

        :</strong> <p>LResistance bands are stretchy strips of rubber that add resistance to workouts with reduced stress on your body. Resistance band workouts are user-friendly, and accessible for beginners. This form of exercise is growing more popular among seniors because of the relatively cheap up-front costs of materials, which makes resistance band workouts ideal for at-home exercise. Additionally, these exercises are ideal for strengthening your core, which improves posture, mobility, and balance.
            
            
            </p>

      <strong>Walking

        :</strong> <p>One of the least stressful and accessible forms of exercise is walking. For some seniors, walking is a bigger challenge than others, so distance and step goals differ from person to person. For the general population, 10,000 steps per day is advised for a healthy lifestyle, but those with difficulty walking or joint pain may settle for a smaller number as a goal. A PLOS One study found that walking 10,000 steps lowered the ten-year outlook for mortality by 46%.
            Walking promotes a healthy lifestyle, while strengthening muscles, lowering your risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and colon cancer.
            
        </p>
        Ideas for walking exercises for seniors:

<br>
<ol><li>Find a moderate trail through a park

</li><li>Find a walk-friendly race to train for

</li><li> Walk the perimeter of a familiar building

</li><li>Find an audiobook or a playlist for stimulation during your walk
